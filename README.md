# ManHunt-Compass

A Compass mod for Minecraft ManHunt, but in forge.

## The beginning of the ManHunt Mod idea

Well, it's been a long time since I last worked on a Mod (longer if you're counting from the time I came up with the idea), during which time I (perhaps deliberately) forgot to work on it, and my peers were too busy with their own projects to help me, so I decided to put the project on hold for a while.

I had set a goal that was too far away and unrealistic, so I decided to start with a small project (Minecraft ManHunt would be great) to retrain myself, so I decided to start the development of this mod to practice.

## About this mod itself

In order to keep up with recent releases, I decided to start writing this mod from Minecraft version 1.16.5 _~~(Maybe I'll code a plugin version of this mod in the future)~~_

## Finally

IDK if you'll like it, but I hope you'll enjoy it. Have fun!

# 猎人游戏-指南针

一个指南针的 mod 为我的世界追捕，但在锻造。

## “追捕 Mod”理念的开始

好吧，距离我上一次制作 Mod 已经有很长一段时间了(如果你从我想出这个想法的时间算起，时间就更长了)，在这段时间里，我(可能是故意的)忘记了制作它，而我的同事们都忙于自己的项目而无法帮助我，所以我决定暂时搁置*这个*项目。

我设定了一个太遥远和不切实际的目标，所以我决定从一个小项目开始(Minecraft ManHunt 会很棒)来重新训练自己，所以我决定开始开发这个 mod 来练习。

## 关于这个 mod 本身

为了跟上最近的版本，我决定从 Minecraft 1.16.5 版本开始编写这个 mod _~~(也许我会在将来编写这个 mod 的插件版本)~~_

## 最后

我不知道你会不会喜欢，但我希望你会喜欢。玩得开心!
